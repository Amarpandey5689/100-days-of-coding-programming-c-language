# 100-days-of-coding-programming-c-language
The 100 Days of Code Challenge is a personal commitment to code every day for 100 days, and share your progress publicly. When focused on the C programming language, the challenge becomes a structured and consistent way to master core programming concepts using one of the most fundamental languages in computer science.
